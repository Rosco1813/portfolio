# Ross Jameson Resume Site

Modern React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind single-page interactive resume themed subtly with fantasy TCG aesthetics (gold accents, parchment hints) while remaining professional.

## Sections
- Hero / About

- Projects Grid
- Skills Matrix

- Contact / Footer

## Getting Started
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Build
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Customization Ideas
1. Replace placeholder data in components under `src/components/sections`.
2. Add real links (LinkedIn, GitHub, Email, PDF resume).
3. Consider adding a page view analytics script (e.g., Plausible) for insight.
4. Add Open Graph and Twitter meta tags in `App.tsx` Helmet.
5. Deploy to Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages.

## HR Appeal Notes (Wizards of the Coast)
- Uses terminology referencing color pie & encounter design tastefully; shows domain familiarity.
- Emphasizes engineering impact (metrics) and collaboration.
- Accessible: semantic HTML, high contrast, focus states.
- Mobile-first responsive layout.
